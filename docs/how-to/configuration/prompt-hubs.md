## Overview

AgentPool supports integration with leading prompt hub platforms:

- **PromptLayer**: Comprehensive prompt management with versioning and analytics
- **Langfuse**: Open-source LLM engineering platform with prompt management
- **Fabric**: Community-driven prompt patterns and templates
- **Braintrust**: Enterprise prompt management with evaluation and testing

These integrations allow you to fetch prompts from these services by identifiers.
