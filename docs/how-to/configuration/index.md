The agent manifest is a YAML file that defines your complete agent setup.
The configuration is powered by [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and provides excellent validation
and IDE support for YAML linters by providing an extensive, detailed schema.

## Top-Level Structure

Here's the complete manifest structure with all available top-level sections:

/// mknodes
{{ "wolfharness.AgentsManifest" | schema_to_markdown(display_mode="yaml", header_style="pymdownx", as_listitem=False) }}
///

## Top-Level Sections

### `agents`

Dictionary of individual agent configurations. Each key is an agent identifier, and the value is the complete agent configuration.

See [Agent Configuration](./node-types/index.md) for detailed agent setup options.

### `teams`  

Dictionary of team configurations for multi-agent workflows. Teams can run agents in parallel or sequence.

See [Team Configuration](./node-types/team.md) for team setup and coordination.

### `responses`

Dictionary of shared response type definitions that can be referenced by agents. Supports both inline schema definitions and imported Python types.

See [Response Configuration](./responses.md) for structured output setup.

### `storage`

Configuration for how agent interactions are stored and logged. Supports multiple storage providers.

See [Storage Configuration](./storage.md) for persistence and logging options.

### `observability`

Configuration for monitoring and telemetry collection.

### `conversion`

Settings for document and media conversion capabilities.

### `mcp_servers`

Global Model Context Protocol server configurations that provide tools and resources to agents.

See [MCP Configuration](./mcp.md) for server setup and integration.

### `pool_server`

Configuration for the pool server that exposes agent functionality to external clients.

### `prompts`

Global prompt library configuration and management.

See [Prompt Configuration](./prompts.md) for prompt organization.

### `commands`

Global command shortcuts that can be used across agents for prompt injection.

### `jobs`

Pre-defined reusable tasks with templates, knowledge requirements, and expected outputs.

See [Task Configuration](./tasks.md) for job definitions.

### `resources`

Global resource definitions for filesystems, APIs, and data sources that agents can access.

### `skills`

Configuration for automatic skills injection into agent system prompts.

See [Skills Configuration](./skills.md) for setup and injection modes.

## Configuration Resolution

AgentPool uses a layered configuration system inspired by OpenCode. Multiple config files are automatically discovered and deep-merged, allowing you to set global preferences while overriding project-specific settings.

### Precedence Order

Configs are loaded and merged in this order (later sources override earlier ones):

| Priority | Source | Location | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Global | `~/.config/wolfharness/wolfharness.yml` | User-wide preferences |
| 2 | Custom | `AGENTPOOL_CONFIG` env var | CI/deployment overrides |
| 3 | Inline | `AGENTPOOL_CONFIG_CONTENT` env var | Runtime config as YAML/JSON string |
| 4 | Project | `wolfharness.yml` in project root | Project-specific settings |
| 5 | Explicit | CLI argument | Highest precedence |
| fallback | Built-in | Package defaults | Only if no agents defined elsewhere |

!!! info "Deep Merge Behavior"
    Configs are **deep-merged**, not replaced. This means:
    
    - Nested dictionaries are merged recursively
    - Conflicting keys are overridden by higher-precedence sources
    - Non-conflicting settings from all sources are preserved
    - Lists are replaced entirely (not concatenated)

### Project Config Discovery

Project config is discovered by searching for `wolfharness.yml` (or `.yaml`, `.json`, `.jsonc`) starting from the current directory and traversing up to the nearest git repository root.

### Fallback Behavior

The built-in fallback config (e.g., `acp_assistant.yml`) is **only loaded if no agents are defined** in any of the other layers. This ensures that:

- Users who define their own agents don't get polluted with default agents
- Users without any config still get a working default assistant

### Example: Layered Configuration

=== "Global config"

    ```yaml title="~/.config/wolfharness/wolfharness.yml"
    # User preferences applied everywhere
    model_variants:
      fast:
        type: string
        identifier: openai:gpt-4o-mini
      smart:
        type: anthropic
        identifier: claude-sonnet-4-5
    
    storage:
      provider: sql
      database_url: sqlite:///~/.local/share/wolfharness/history.db
    ```

=== "Project config"

    ```yaml title="./wolfharness.yml"
    # Project-specific agents (inherits global model_variants and storage)
    agents:
      coder:
        model: smart  # References global variant
        system_prompt: "You are an expert Python developer."
        tools:
          - type: file_access
          - type: bash
    ```

=== "Result"

    The merged config contains both the global `model_variants`/`storage` and the project's `agents`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AGENTPOOL_CONFIG` | Path to custom config file |
| `AGENTPOOL_CONFIG_CONTENT` | Inline YAML/JSON config content |
| `AGENTPOOL_NO_GLOBAL_CONFIG` | Set to disable global config loading |
| `AGENTPOOL_NO_PROJECT_CONFIG` | Set to disable project config discovery |
| `AGENTPOOL_USE_SESSION_POOL_FOR_COMMANDS` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to route commands through SessionPool |
| `AGENTPOOL_USE_SESSION_POOL_FOR_SKILLS` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to route skills through SessionPool |
| `AGENTPOOL_USE_SESSION_POOL_FOR_INIT` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to use SessionPool during initialization |
| `AGENTPOOL_USE_SESSION_POOL_FOR_SUMMARIZE` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to route summarization through SessionPool |
| `AGENTPOOL_USE_SESSION_POOL_FOR_MCP` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to route MCP calls through SessionPool |

!!! note "SessionPool Feature Flags"
    Category flags are only evaluated when the global `use_session_pool` setting is `True`.
    The `OpenCodeConfig.should_use_session_pool_for(category)` helper checks the global
    master switch first, then the specific category flag.

### CLI Commands

Use these commands to inspect config resolution:

```bash
# Show which configs are found and loaded
wolfharness config show

# Show standard config paths
wolfharness config paths

# Create a starter config file
wolfharness config init           # In current project
wolfharness config init global    # In global config dir
```

## File-Level Inheritance (INHERIT)

In addition to layered resolution, individual config files can use the `INHERIT` key to explicitly inherit from another file:

=== "Base config"

    ```yaml title="base.yml"
    storage:
      log_messages: true
    agents:
      base_agent:
        model: "openai:gpt-5"
        retries: 2
    ```

=== "Specialized config"

    ```yaml title="agents.yml"
    INHERIT: base-config.yml
    agents:
      my_agent:
        model: openai:gpt-5
        description: "Specialized agent"
    ```

AgentPool supports UPaths (universal-pathlib) for `INHERIT`, allowing pointing to remote configurations (`http://path/to/config.yml`).

## Schema Validation

You can get IDE linter support by adding this line at the top of your YAML:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Million-mo/wolfharness/refs/heads/main/schema/config-schema.json
```

!!! note
    Versioned config files will arrive soon for better stability!

## Usage

Load a manifest in your code:

```python
from wolfharness import AgentPool

async with AgentPool("agents.yml") as pool:
    agent = pool.get_agent("analyzer")
    result = await agent.run("Analyze this code...")
```
