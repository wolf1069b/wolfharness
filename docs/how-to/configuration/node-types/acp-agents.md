ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) agents allow integration of external coding agents and AI assistants into the AgentPool pool. These agents run as separate processes and communicate via the ACP protocol.

## Overview

AgentPool supports integration with many popular coding agents:

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's Claude-based coding agent
- **Gemini CLI**: Google's Gemini-based coding agent
- **Codex**: OpenAI Codex-based agent
- **OpenCode**: Open-source coding agent
- **Goose**: Block's AI coding assistant
- **OpenHands**: Open-source AI coding agent
- **FastAgent**: Fast and lightweight coding agent
- **Amp**: Sourcegraph's AI coding assistant
- **Auggie**: AI pair programming assistant
- **Cagent**: AI coding agent
- **Kimi**: Moonshot's AI coding agent
- **Stakpak**: AI infrastructure assistant
- **VTCode**: Visual Studio Code AI assistant
- **Mistral**: Mistral AI's coding agent

These agents can be configured to work alongside AgentPool agents, enabling hybrid workflows that leverage specialized external tools.

## Configuration Notes

- ACP agents run as separate processes managed by AgentPool
- Each agent type has specific configuration options for its underlying tool
- Model selection depends on what the external agent supports
- MCP servers can be attached to capable agents for extended functionality
- Environment variables can be used for API keys and secrets
- Agents are started on-demand and terminated when the pool closes
