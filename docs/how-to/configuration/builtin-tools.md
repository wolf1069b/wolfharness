Built-in tools are native tools provided by LLM providers that can be used to enhance your agent's capabilities. They are executed directly by the model provider.

## Overview

AgentPool supports the following PydanticAI built-in tools:

- **Web Search**: Search the web using various providers
- **Code Execution**: Execute code in a sandboxed environment
- **URL Context**: Fetch and process content from URLs
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using AI models
- **Memory**: Persistent memory storage for agents
- **MCP Server**: Connect to MCP server tools

These tools integrate seamlessly with the agent's capability system and can be configured with provider-specific options.
