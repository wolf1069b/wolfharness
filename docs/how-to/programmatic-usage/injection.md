# Agent Injection and Execution Patterns

AgentPool provides a clean, pytest-inspired way to work with agents. Instead of complex decorators
or string-based configurations, agents are automatically injected as function parameters.

## Basic Agent Injection

Agents defined in your YAML configuration are automatically available as function parameters:

```python
async def analyze_code(
    analyzer: Agent[None],
    reviewer: Agent[None],
    code: str,
) -> CodeAnalysis:
    """Analyze and review code using two agents."""
    analysis = await analyzer.run(f"Analyze this code:\n{code}")
    review = await reviewer.run(f"Review this analysis:\n{analysis.content}")
    return CodeAnalysis(analysis=analysis.content, review=review.content)
```

The function receives fully configured agents matching the parameter names from your YAML:

```yaml
agents:
  analyzer:
    model: gpt-5
    system_prompt: "You are an expert code analyzer..."
  reviewer:
    model: gpt-5
    system_prompt: "You are an expert code reviewer..."
```

## Function Execution Patterns

### Basic Function with Type Safety

The `node_function` decorator marks functions for automatic execution and provides type checking between functions:

```python
@node_function
async def gather_data(
    researcher: Agent[None],
    topic: str,
) -> list[str]:  # Return type is enforced
    """Gather research data."""
    result = await researcher.run(f"Research: {topic}")
    return result.data.split("\n")

@node_function(depends_on="gather_data")
async def analyze_data(
    analyst: Agent[None],
    gather_data: list[str],  # Type must match return type of gather_data
) -> str:
    """Analyze the gathered data."""
    return await analyst.run(f"Analyze these points:\n{'\n'.join(gather_data)}")
```

The system ensures type safety between functions:

- Return types are checked against dependency parameter types
- Runtime type checking of actual values
- Clear error messages for type mismatches

### Sequential Dependencies

Functions can depend on the results of other functions:

```python
@node_function
async def research_topic(
    researcher: Agent[None],
    topic: str,
) -> str:
    return await researcher.run(f"Research: {topic}")

@node_function(depends_on="research_topic")
async def write_article(
    writer: Agent[None],
    research_topic: str,  # Gets typed result from research_topic
) -> str:
    return await writer.run(f"Write article based on:\n{research_topic}")
```

### Parallel Execution

Functions without dependencies can run in parallel:

```python
@node_function
async def expert1_review(
    expert1: Agent[None],
    document: str,
) -> str:
    return await expert1.run(f"Review: {document}")

@node_function
async def expert2_review(
    expert2: Agent[None],
    document: str,
) -> str:
    return await expert2.run(f"Review: {document}")

# Execute both reviews in parallel:
results = await execute_functions(
    [expert1_review, expert2_review],
    pool=pool,
    inputs={"document": "..."},
    parallel=True,
)
```

### Worker Pattern

Register agents as tools for other agents:

```python
@node_function
async def improve_code(
    manager: Agent[None],
    formatter: Agent[None],
    type_checker: Agent[None],
    code: str,
) -> str:
    # Register specialists as tools for manager
    manager.register_worker(formatter)
    manager.register_worker(type_checker)
    return await manager.run(f"Improve this code:\n{code}")
```

## Type Safety

The system provides comprehensive type checking:

```python
# Type mismatch between functions
@node_function
async def get_numbers(
    agent: Agent[None],
) -> list[int]:
    return [1, 2, 3]

@node_function(depends_on="get_numbers")
async def process_data(
    agent: Agent[None],
    get_numbers: str,  # Wrong type! Expected list[int]
) -> str:
    ...  # Raises: TypeError: Type mismatch in process_data: dependency 'get_numbers' is typed as str, but get_numbers returns list[int]

# Runtime type checking
@node_function
async def validate_data(
    agent: Agent[None],
) -> list[str]:
    return 42  # Wrong return type!
    # Raises: TypeError: Type error in validate_data: return value expected list[str], got int
```

Type checking is:

- Optional (untyped functions work normally)
- Enforced between dependencies
- Validated at runtime
- Clear about errors

### Continuous Monitoring

Set up agents for continuous operation:

```python
@node_function
async def monitor_system(
    watcher: Agent[None],
    alerter: Agent[None],
):
    await watcher.run_in_background(
        "Check system status",
        interval=300,  # every 5 minutes
        max_count=None,  # run indefinitely
    )
    watcher.connect_to(alerter)
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Type Hints**: Always use `Agent[None]` or appropriate generic type for proper typing.

2. **Default Values**: Use `Agent[None] | None = None` when agent is optional:

```python
async def optional_review(
    reviewer: Agent[None] | None = None,
    text: str,
) -> str:
    if reviewer:
        return await reviewer.run(f"Review: {text}")
    return text
```

3. **Pool Access**: You can also inject the pool directly:

```python
async def dynamic_team(
    pool: AgentPool,
    task: str,
):
    team = [pool.get_agent(name) for name in ["agent1", "agent2"]]
    group = Team(team)
    return await group.execute(task)
```

4. **Context Sharing**: Use shared dependencies for coordinated agents:

```python
async def shared_analysis(
    analyzer1: Agent[Context],
    analyzer2: Agent[Context],
    context: Context,
):
    group = Team[Context]([analyzer1, analyzer2])
    return await group.execute("Analyze using shared context")
```

The connection between your YAML manifest and the injection system is made through the AgentPool:

```python
from wolfharness import AgentPool, AgentsManifest

# 1. Define your agents in YAML
manifest = """
agents:
  researcher:
    model: gpt-5
    system_prompt: "You are an expert researcher..."
  writer:
    model: gpt-5
    system_prompt: "You are an expert writer..."
"""

# 2. Create pool from manifest
async def main():
    async with AgentPool(manifest) as pool:
        # 3. Connect injection system via decorator
        @with_nodes(pool)
        async def research_and_write(
            researcher: Agent[None],  # Will get "researcher" from pool
            writer: Agent[None],      # Will get "writer" from pool
            topic: str,
        ) -> str:
            research = await researcher.run(f"Research: {topic}")
            return await writer.run(f"Write about:\n{research.content}")

        # 4. Use the function - agents are automatically injected
        result = await research_and_write(topic="quantum computing")
```

The key is that the `with_nodes` decorator needs a pool, which is your connection to the manifest. This design:

1. Keeps configuration in YAML (easy to edit/version)
2. Provides clean dependency injection in code
3. Allows flexible pool management strategies
4. Maintains type safety throughout
