# Examples

This section contains practical examples demonstrating various features and patterns in AgentPool.

## Agent Patterns

### [Create Docs](create_docs/)

Agent collaboration for documentation generation - demonstrates how multiple agents can work together to create structured documentation.

### [CrewAI-Style Flow](crewai_flow/)

Adaptation of CrewAI-like workflow patterns - shows how to implement familiar workflow patterns from other frameworks.

### [PyTest-Style Functions](pytest_style/)

PyTest-style example patterns - demonstrates testing patterns and function-based agent definitions.

## Multi-Agent Communication

### [Round-Robin Communication](round_robin/)

Round-robin message passing between agents - shows how to implement circular communication patterns.

## Downloads & Workers

### [Download Agents](download_agents/)

Sequential vs parallel downloads comparison - compares different approaches to handling multiple download tasks.

### [Download Workers](download_workers/)

Using agents as tools for downloads - shows how to use one agent as a tool for another.

## MCP Integration

### [MCP Servers (YAML)](mcp_servers_yaml/)

MCP server integration with git tools - demonstrates how to integrate MCP servers via YAML configuration.

### [MCP Sampling & Elicitation](mcp_sampling_elicitation/)

MCP server with sampling tools - shows advanced MCP features including sampling and elicitation.

### [MCP Skills](mcp_skills/)

Using MCP-exposed skills via the skill:// URI scheme - demonstrates how to use both prompt-based and resource-based skills from MCP servers.

## Skills

### [Skill URI Loading](skill_uri_loading/)

Loading skills using the skill:// URI scheme - demonstrates short name auto-routing and full URI loading.

### [Skills with References](skill_with_references/)

Creating skills with supporting reference files - demonstrates how to bundle templates, examples, and guides with skills.

## Structured Responses

### [Structured Responses](structured_response/)

Structured response type examples - demonstrates how to define and use typed response models.

## Human Interaction

### [Human Interaction](human_interaction/)

AI-Human interaction patterns - shows how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows.

## Model Comparison

### [Model Comparison](model_comparison/)

Comparing different models using parallel teams - demonstrates how to run the same task across multiple models simultaneously.
