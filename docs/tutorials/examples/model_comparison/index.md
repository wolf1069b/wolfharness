# Model Comparison

This example demonstrates comparing different AI models using parallel teams in AgentPool.
## Code

### `main.py`

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = ["wolfharness"]
# ///


"""Example of comparing different models using parallel teams.

This example demonstrates:
- Dynamic agent creation using different models
- Team creation and management
- Parallel execution for model comparison
- Result analysis and comparison
"""

1. Create two agents:
   - Name: "gpt5_agent" using model "openai:gpt-5"
   - Name: "gpt5_mini_agent" using model "openai:gpt-5-mini"

2. Create a parallel team with the name "comparison_team".
   It should contain both agents just created.

3. Delegate this task to the team:
   "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in exactly three sentences."

4. Analyze the responses, paying attention to:
   - Differences in explanation style and depth
   - Response time differences
   - Costs
   - Quality of the three-sentence constraint adherence
