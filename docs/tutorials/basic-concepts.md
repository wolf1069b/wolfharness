# Basic Concepts

## Node Hierarchy

AgentPool uses a unified **node** abstraction for all message-processing entities. This enables seamless composition and communication between different types of agents.


````python exec="true"
from wolfharness.messaging import MessageNode
node = mk.MkClassDiagram(MessageNode, mode="subclasses")
print(node)
````




### MessageNode

The base interface that all nodes implement. A node can receive messages, process them, and emit responses. This common interface allows uniform handling regardless of implementation.

### Agents

Native LLM-powered agents defined in your configuration:

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    model: openai:gpt-4
    system_prompt: You are a helpful assistant.
```

Agents are the most flexible nodes - they support tools, structured output, conversation history, and all framework features.

### ACP Agents

External coding agents integrated via the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/). These wrap tools like Claude Code, Goose, Codex, or fast-agent as nodes:

```yaml
agents:
  claude:
    type: acp
    provider: claude
    cwd: /path/to/project
  goose:
    type: goose
```

ACP agents appear alongside native agents in your pool and can be connected, composed into teams, or used as tools - just like any other node.

### Teams

Groups of nodes that execute together:

- **Parallel teams** (`agent1 & agent2`): All nodes run simultaneously
- **Sequential pipelines** (`agent1 | agent2`): Output flows from one to the next

Teams themselves are nodes, enabling nested composition.

### Why This Matters

The unified node model means you can:

- Connect a native agent to an ACP agent
- Build a team mixing Claude Code with your custom agents
- Use any node as a tool for another node
- Apply the same monitoring, logging, and storage to all nodes

## Core Components

### Configuration and YAML

AgentPool excels at static definition of agents using a YAML configuration:

```yaml
# agents.yml (AgentsManifest)
agents:
  analyzer:    # NativeAgentConfig
    analyzer:
        model: "openai:gpt-5"
        system_prompt: ...
        tools: [...]
  planner:
    model: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0"
    ...
```

The YAML schema is very detailed and well-defined and should allow setting up Agent pools via YAML without having to permanently consult the docs.

It is possible to:

- Define Agents (ACP, AGUI, regular) & teams
- Assign tools, toolsets, mcp servers
- Connect the agent to other agents with different "Connection types"
- Define and assign respone types for structured output in YAML
- Define and activate event triggers in YAML
- Set up (multiple) storage providers to write the conversations, tool calls, commands and much more to databases as well as files (pretty-printed or structured)
- Load previous conversations and even describe the Queries in the yaml file using simple syntax
- Assign agents to other agents for agent-as-a-tool-usage


AgentPool is built around the idea that AI agents should be:

- Easily configurable through YAML
- Fully reproducible
- Version controllable
- Human readable and verifiable
- Shareable across teams and projects

This means you can define complete agents, their capabilities, and their environments in pure YAML without writing any code.

Define complete agents in YAML without writing code:

```yaml
# agents.yml
agents:
  web_assistant:
    model: openai:gpt-5
    tools:
      - type: import
        name: open_url
        import_path: webbrowser.open
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful web assistant."
```

### Agent Pools

A Pool is a collection of agents that can:

- Share resources and knowledge
- Discover each other
- Communicate and delegate tasks
- Be monitored and supervised

Think of a pool as a workspace where agents can collaborate.

### Teams

Teams are dynamic groups of agents from a pool that work together on specific tasks. They support:

- Parallel execution
- Sequential processing
- Controlled communication
- Result aggregation

### Connections

Connections define how agents communicate. They include:

- Direct message forwarding
- Context sharing
- Task delegation
- Response awaiting

Connections can be:

- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Temporary or permanent
- Conditional or unconditional
- Queued, accumulated, debounced, filtered
- Team-to-Team, Team-to-Callable, Team-to-Agent

### Tasks

Tasks are pre-defined operations that agents can execute. They include:

- Prompt templates
- Required tools
- Knowledge sources
- Expected result types
