The AgentPool CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands to manage and interact with AI agents.
It's designed around the concept of an "active agent file" - a YAML configuration that defines your agents and their settings.
This avoids the need to pass the config file path each time you want to run a command.

## Active Agent File

The CLI maintains an "active agent file" setting which determines which agents are available for commands like `run`, `task`, or `watch`.
You can:

- Add agent files with `wolfharness add <name> <path>`
- Set the active file with `wolfharness set <name>`
- List agents from the active config with `wolfharness list`

Most commands will use the currently active agent file by default, but can be overridden with the `--config` option.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automatic Config Discovery

AgentPool automatically discovers config files. Just create `wolfharness.yml` in your project:

```bash
# Create a starter config
wolfharness config init

# Edit the config, then run
wolfharness run myagent "Hello"
```

### Option 2: Named Configurations

For managing multiple config files:

1. Add and activate an agent configuration:

   ```bash
   wolfharness add myconfig agents.yml
   wolfharness set myconfig
   ```

2. List available agents:

   ```bash
   wolfharness list
   ```

3. Run a prompt with an agent:

   ```bash
   wolfharness run analyzer "Analyze this text"
   ```

## Command Examples

### Running Agents

```bash
# Run a single agent with a prompt
wolfharness run myagent "Analyze this"

# Run a team
wolfharness run myteam "Process this"

# Show detailed output with costs
wolfharness run myagent "Hello" --detail full --costs
```

### Executing Tasks

```bash
# Execute a defined task
wolfharness task docs write_api_docs

# Execute with additional prompt
wolfharness task docs write_api_docs --prompt "Include code examples"
```

### Server Commands

```bash
# ACP server for IDE integration (Zed, Toad)
wolfharness serve-acp config.yml

# OpenCode server for OpenCode TUI/Desktop
wolfharness serve-opencode config.yml --port 4096

# MCP server (stdio transport)
wolfharness serve-mcp config.yml

# MCP server with SSE transport
wolfharness serve-mcp config.yml --transport sse --port 3001

# AG-UI server
wolfharness serve-agui config.yml --port 8002

# OpenAI-compatible API server
wolfharness serve-api config.yml --port 8000
```

### History Commands

```bash
# Show last 5 conversations
wolfharness history show -n 5

# Show conversations from last 24 hours
wolfharness history show --period 24h

# Show stats grouped by model
wolfharness history stats --period 1w --group-by model

# Clear history for specific agent
wolfharness history reset --agent myagent
```

## Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--log-level`, `-l` | Set log level (default: info) |
| `--help` | Show help message |

## Configuration Files

Agent configurations are YAML files that define:

- Available agents and their capabilities
- System prompts and knowledge sources
- Tool configurations
- Response types
- And more

Example:

```yaml
agents:
  analyzer:
    display_name: "Text Analyzer"
    model: openai:gpt-4o
    description: "Analyzes text and provides structured output"
    tools:
      - type: file_access
```

See the [Configuration Guide](../../how-to/configuration/index.md) for detailed information about agent configuration.
