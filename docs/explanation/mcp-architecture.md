# MCP & Tool Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### MCPManager (`wolfharness.mcp_server.manager`)
Manages MCP server **lifecycle** only. Spawns MCP server processes, wraps each in an
`MCPResourceProvider`, and aggregates them into an `AggregatingResourceProvider`.
Does NOT wire providers into ToolManager — that happens externally.

Lives on `MessageNode` (every agent has one) and on `AgentPool` / `BaseTeam`.

### ToolManager (`wolfharness.tools.manager`)
Manages local tools + external resource providers. MCP tools become available when
someone adds the MCPManager's aggregating provider to the ToolManager.

### ToolManagerBridge (`wolfharness.mcp_server.tool_bridge`)
The inverse of MCPManager: exposes an agent's internal ToolManager as an HTTP MCP
server. Used by wrapped agents (Claude Code, Codex, ACP) so the external process
can call back into our tools.

## Provider Wiring — Three Layers

MCPManager only handles lifecycle. The **wiring** of providers into ToolManager
happens at three levels:

### 1. Agent-level (`self.mcp`)
Every MessageNode gets its own MCPManager from configured `mcp_servers`.
- **Native Agent**: Wires it in `__init__`:
  `self.tools.add_provider(self.mcp.get_aggregating_provider())` (`agent.py:263`)
- **Wrapped agents**: MCPManager is started (lifecycle runs) but **nobody wires**
  the providers into anything. The providers exist but are unused.

### 2. Pool-level (`pool.mcp`)
Pool has its own MCPManager for pool-wide MCP servers (from manifest).
In `pool.__aenter__()`, adds its aggregating provider to **every** agent's
ToolManager (`pool.py:176`). Removed in `pool.__aexit__()`.

- Works for Native Agents (they use ToolManager for LLM calls).
- Added to wrapped agents' ToolManager too, but **effectively invisible** — they
  don't use ToolManager for their LLM calls.

### 3. Team-level (`team.mcp`)
Teams have their own MCPManager. In `_on_node_added()`, adds the team's aggregating
provider to Native Agents' ToolManagers (`base_team.py:102`).

- Only wired for `Agent` instances (isinstance check).
- Wrapped agents in teams don't get team MCP tools.

## Per-Agent Breakdown

### Native Agent (`Agent`)
- **MCP connections**: MCPManager on MessageNode. Aggregating provider wired into
  ToolManager by the agent itself. Pool/team providers also added externally.
- **Tool exposure**: In-process. No bridge needed.
- **Dynamic changes**: Yes — ToolManager is live, tools/providers can be
  added/removed between calls.
- **Uses MCPManager providers**: Yes (all three layers).
- **Uses ToolBridge**: No.

### AG-UI Agent (`AGUIAgent`)
- **MCP connections**: MCPManager on MessageNode is started, but providers are
  **not wired** into the AG-UI request flow. Only `self.tools` (ToolManager)
  tools are converted to AG-UI format and sent per HTTP request.
- **Tool exposure**: Per-call schemas sent to remote AG-UI server. Client-side
  execution when the server calls them back.
- **Dynamic changes**: Can register ToolManager tools at runtime. MCP tool
  integration is incomplete — MCPManager tools don't flow into AG-UI requests.
- **Uses MCPManager providers**: No (started but not wired).
- **Uses ToolBridge**: No.

### Claude Code Agent (`ClaudeCodeAgent`)
- **MCP connections**: Does NOT use MessageNode's MCPManager for connections.
  Maintains `_mcp_servers: dict[str, McpServerConfig]` in Claude SDK format.
  External configs converted at startup. All passed to SDK client at connection
  time — Claude Code handles MCP connections natively.
- **Tool exposure**: Via **ToolManagerBridge** — starts an HTTP MCP server that
  the Claude Code process connects to as one of its MCP servers.
- **Dynamic changes**: SDK supports `set_mcp_servers` control request for dynamic
  add/remove mid-session. `toolChanged` notifications from bridge don't work
  properly yet.
- **Uses MCPManager providers**: No (MessageNode's MCPManager runs but is ignored).
- **Uses ToolBridge**: Yes. Bridge config merged into `_mcp_servers` dict.

### Codex Agent (`CodexAgent`)
- **MCP connections**: Collects configs at startup: bridge config + external configs
  converted to Codex format. All passed to `CodexClient(mcp_servers=...)`.
  **Startup only.**
- **Tool exposure**: Via **ToolManagerBridge** (same pattern as Claude Code).
- **Dynamic changes**: None. Codex CLI (Rust) has no runtime MCP modification API.
- **Uses MCPManager providers**: No (MessageNode's MCPManager runs but is ignored).
- **Uses ToolBridge**: Yes. `get_codex_mcp_server_config()` returns Codex-format.

### ACP Agent (`ACPAgent`)
- **MCP connections**: Collects from bridge + `self.mcp.servers` (reads the config
  list from MessageNode's MCPManager, but not the providers). Converts to ACP format,
  passes in `NewSessionRequest(mcp_servers=...)`. **Per-session, not dynamic.**
- **Tool exposure**: Via **ToolManagerBridge**.
- **Dynamic changes**: None at MCP level. New session needed for changes.
- **Uses MCPManager providers**: No — only reads `.servers` config list.
- **Uses ToolBridge**: Yes. `get_mcp_server_config()` returns ACP-format.

### Teams (`BaseTeam`)
- **MCP connections**: Own MCPManager. Aggregating provider added to member
  Native Agents' ToolManagers when they join.
- **Delegation only**: Teams don't run tools themselves.
- **Wrapped agents**: Not wired (isinstance check for `Agent` only).

### Pool (`AgentPool`)
- **MCP connections**: Own MCPManager for pool-wide servers.
  Aggregating provider added to all agents' ToolManagers in `__aenter__`.
- **Effective for**: Native Agents only (wrapped agents have ToolManager but
  don't use it for LLM calls).

\* AG-UI starts MCPManager but providers don't flow into AG-UI requests
\** AG-UI can add ToolManager tools dynamically, but MCP integration is incomplete
\*** ACP reads `self.mcp.servers` (config list) but doesn't use providers
\**** Codex supports `config/mcpServer/reload` (re-reads config from disk, rebuilds on next turn)

## Key Observations

1. **MCPManager = lifecycle only.** It spawns processes and creates providers.
   Wiring into ToolManager is done externally by the agent, pool, or team.

2. **Three wiring layers**: Agent-level, pool-level, team-level. Only Native Agent
   benefits from all three. Wrapped agents get pool/team providers added to their
   ToolManager but never use them.

3. **Wrapped agents bypass MCPManager providers.** Claude Code, Codex, and ACP
   all manage their own MCP config dicts/lists and pass them to external processes.
   The MessageNode MCPManager runs uselessly for them.

4. **ACP is a hybrid**: Reads `self.mcp.servers` (config list) but not providers.
   Other wrapped agents ignore MCPManager entirely.

5. **ToolBridge is the inverse of MCPManager**: MCPManager consumes external MCP
   servers (inbound tools). ToolBridge exposes our tools as an MCP server (outbound).

6. **AG-UI gap**: MCPManager providers are started but not available as AG-UI tools.

7. **Pool MCP is invisible to wrapped agents**: Pool adds its aggregating provider
   to every agent's ToolManager, but wrapped agents don't use ToolManager for
   LLM calls, so pool-level MCP tools are inaccessible to them.
